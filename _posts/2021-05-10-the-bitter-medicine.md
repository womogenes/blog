title: The bitter medicine
excerpt: My thoughts on "just pushing through"
---

I'm kind of behind on a project for history class and I have a big English assignment due soon, which I'm procrastinating on by writing this post. :)

I also have to drink this medicine:

<div align="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2021-05-10-the-bitter-medicine/fig1.png" alt="Very *very* bitter medicine" width="400" /></div>

It's really bitterâ€”I just took a tiny sip and it's even worse than I thought.

The point is, I've more or less thought during peaceful times that if there's a difficult task, I just need to face it head-on and push through. Still have mixed feelings on this, but it's probably not practical to always have this mindset.



Will probably update this post in the future!
