Looks like I'm writing a lot on the first day. I was planning to write another math-related thing today, but I'll leave that for later so this doesn't follow the "try hard for a week and then it dies" pattern that a lot of my other projects follow.

I'm writing about this because the temperature's risen recently, but also because I want to test out how images will work.

## My window

This is what my room looks like:

(Apologies to the dark mode people—I use dark mode too (but only during the night). I should write a post on that!)

As we all know, the Earth rotates to the East, or counterclockwise if you look North-down.

(Ah yes, maps can be another topic.)

The Earth spinning in this fashion is the reason we get the phenomenon of the sun rising from the East in the mornings.

## The problem

The Earth's spin also means that my room receives direct sunlight in the mornings. This wasn't so much a problem in fall/winter, but now, when it's spring and almost summer (northern hemisphere gang!), the sun rises much higher.

So it's been getting a lot hotter in here recently and **I can't stand heat.** If it gets to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, then I really need a fan.

I don't want to put the shades down all the time, since I want to keep the air flowing. But I do have to keep them down for a large part of the morning, otherwise the sun would scorch my eyes. I suspect that keeping down the shades in the mornings is part of why I'm so unproductive in the mornings (but actually I'm pretty unproductive all-around...)

Another thing is that the view outside my window is pretty unobstructed—standing at the right location, I can see more or less the whole of the Eastern sky. This is great for things like stargazing and looking at the sky. But this means that my room is also hot now.

On the other hand, the view from the other side of the house (the West side) is pretty obstructed and thus keeps the rooms on that side cool all day.

## Good things about my window

Since my window faces east, I only have to keep the shades down for a few hours in the morning (up to 10am or so), and this means I get to have good natural lighting for the rest of the day.



## Summary

tldr: My room is getting hotter and I blame my window.

I don't even know what the point of this was! Guess it was good to test how pictures work and do a bit more writing. See you in the next post!
