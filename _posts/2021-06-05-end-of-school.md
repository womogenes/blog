title: End of school
excerpt: School is out!
---

School is out! There's no better feeling in the world than being set free and being able to do whatever you want.

But this year is different in quite a few ways, so it doesn't feel complete *as* good as previous years.

- With remote learning, I didn't get the *full* experience of being on campus in the summer sun, the trees rustling as a cool breeze passes by, knowing that the end of school is near near.
- There wasn't a sense of closure, as our calendar is a bit weirdâ€”classes ended last Wednesday, but finals aren't officially finished until next Monday. We also didn't have a final closing assembly. There's also still a few more school-related things I need to wrap up.

I now have a lot of time on my hands. I hadn't considered this too seriously in May because I had a truckload of projects to finish, but I had always though I'd be able to manage my time and have my summer be super productive.

There's quite a few things I want to do, and I'll most likely have time for them. But that involves sitting down and making a proper schedule and beating procrastination. (Which is ironic considering that I'm writing a blog post instead...)

Anyways, I just felt the need to have another post on the blog since it's been almost a month. I'll provide an update on how things go once I do decide to sit down and think things through!
