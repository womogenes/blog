title: Dune movie
excerpt: The new Dune movie is out and I won't watch it
---

The new Dune movie, based on the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert, is out! It's in theaters and on HBO Max.

I started reading the novel this past summer and have been slow to finish it. So far I'm just over sixty percent done. It's been a great book so far, and I definitely want to finish it. However, I had also set a goal for myself to finish the book before the movie was going to be released on October 22nd. And that's today! I'm going to continue reading the book so as to not spoil the movie.

The movie looks really exciting though. I'll try to plow through the rest of the book.

This is a short post.
