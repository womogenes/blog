Welcome to my blog! This is just gonna be a very chill place where I dump my thoughts. It's not going to be very polished and I'll probably sound disorganized at times. No expectations for now!

## Motivation

My motivation for creating this was partly because I wanted to test out Jekyll and see what that's all aboutâ€”turns out it's super easy to use and not that exciting. But I did have to set up Mathjax so I can write these cool equations:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

Very epic. It turns out Mathjax wasn't that hard to add either. But now I can write about mathematics in this blog!

Another thing was that I've discovered [Wait But Why](https://www.waitbutwhy.com) recently and have been spending too much time reading their posts. This probably means I'll end up writing like Tim Urban for a while, which is pretty cringy so I'll try to avoid that.

I'll have to convince myself that this blog is worth updating so it doesn't end up as something with 3 posts. I'd like to avoid looking back on this in the future and feeling bad that it's inactive.

That being said, right now I anticipate this to be something I come back to every week or so to rant. Low stakes, no pressure. Not a lot of people are going to read this anyway right? I think about all the blogs that must have such interesting content and I feel bad for not reading those. But for now this is going to be low-quality and I hope I don't spend too much time on it.

(Also this is how I can justify working on my blog instead of making videos.)

Slowly over time, I guess my writing'll become more organized and more appealing to read, 'cause nobody wants to read someone else's stream of consciousness.

As I write this, I also realize just how **satisfying** writing this is. Typora is so clean and minimalist, and the generated site is so clean and minimalist. It's so deliciously clean and minimalist! And I can edit the styles 'cause I know css. ðŸ˜Ž

## Tools

I guess I should talk a bit about the tools I'm using. My tech stack is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the static site generator, [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), for the hosting, and [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/), for the math rendering.

For now, my tools are [Typora](https://typora.io/) for writing and vscode for editing the code and doing git.

And that's it for now! I plan to write something else soon.
