## The story

I've been holding off on this post on a while now, but as long as I keep putting off writing about this the standard is only going to rise.

A few years ago, I used light mode for everything, and hadn't even heard of dark mode.

Then I heard that dark mode was a thing. At first, I thought it was a gimmick and that all the "agh light mode is too bright it hurts my eyes" stuff was all excuses. Mostly I thought of it as a thing programmers used for their IDEs to look cool.

At some point I tried out the [Dark Reader Chrome extension](https://darkreader.org/) and it looked kind of weird on some sites and I thought it was super hacky, so didn't continue using it.

Late 2020, I started seriously considering it, but was reluctant because not every site had dark mode—sure, Discord, Youtube...supported dark mode, but not *all* sites. Eventually, I came around and started using the Dark Reader extension, and it worked great!

Today, I still use light mode by default, but switch to dark mode after sunset because of the strain on my eyes. Looking at a bright monitor when it's dark outside doesn't feel great! Also, I am very *very* glad that Discord came out with this feature:

![Discord "sync with computer" setting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2021-05-07-dark-mode/fig1.png)

That's the "sync with computer" setting. I'm so glad this has arrived because I manually switch from dark mode to light mode in the morning and from light to dark at night. Thank you Discord devs!



## Discord dark mode

Some of you might be angry at me for using Discord light mode, but I'm just following my protocol! I think that people who use in Dark mode do it because it's the default and just out of habit. Very recently I started using Discord dark-mode-only because the switching became inconvenient. I understand that dark mode might look better than light mode right now, but if you get used to it I'm sure you'll be fine.

I also use MS Teams in dark mode permanently (for the time being) because it has no option to sync with system theme, and it's more bearable to me to use a dark app during the day than to use a light app at night. And now I think dark mode is the only acceptable theme for Teams! I'm no longer used to light Teams and think it looks ugly that way.

So tl;dr, I think people use Discord dark mode because it's the default and it was a hassle to switch, and now people are used to it.



## Problems

There are a few issues for me being someone who switches between light and dark mode daily.

### 1. It's inconvenient

Having to go into Windows settings (might do a post on OSes later!) every day and toggle from light to dark is a little inconvenient. I wish it either had an automatic way to do it (like [iOS does](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20912301/iphone-ipad-how-to-auto-switch-light-dark-theme-mode-appearance-sunset-sunrise)), or it was more accessible. But putting a setting that most people don't use very often isn't a great decision, and I'm sure there's something out there that lets me access Windows settings more quickly. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### 2. Images are weird

Most images are good, but when I go to a site that has images with a bright background and a drawing or writing in dark, it doesn't blend in with the rest of the page:

![Discord "sync with computer" setting]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2021-05-07-dark-mode/fig2.png)

### 3. vscode actually looks better in dark mode

Ooh, IDEs could be a good topic for a future post! Before I started using dark mode, I changed the default theme for my vscode to light because I thought light mode was just superior. But after switching, I realized that dark mode works much better for me for coding. Sorry about thinking that dark IDEs were simply to look cool :/

### 4. Dark mode might actually be worse on the eyes

Maybe, maybe not. I don't know if there have been extensive studies on this, but it can't be *that* bad...right?

I'll think of more problems in the future, but that's it for now. Thanks for reading!
